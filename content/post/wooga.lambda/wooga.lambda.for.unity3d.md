*Wooga.Lambda* is a new functional library written in C# and mainly useful to developers that are stuck with *.Net 3.5* or need to target *Unity3D*.

//TODO:

> ![](/post/wooga.lambda/lambda.logo.png)
With **Unity3D** being so far behind the **.NET** and **Mono** world, this library is an attempt at backporting some features found in more recent runtimes and C# libraries as well as pick up and harness useful ideas and patterns from other languages and programming paradigms.
